/*
 * Originally I wanted this class to be able to be used under two different
 * circumstances: (1) where a given DnaSeq object is responsible for allocating
 * its buffer memory and freeing it and (2) where a DnaBuffer object provides
 * the memory and the DnaSeq object provided a pointer into that buffer. In
 * C this would be easy to do, but I don't fully understand C++ yet and so
 * ran into problems where the copy constructor was being automatically called
 * in certain cases. The copy constructor was implemented to allocate a new
 * memory buffer. This in itself is not problematic, but when I wanted to use
 * the raw pointer of a given DnaSeq object to find its offset within a DnaBuffer,
 * I was getting garbage because the the DnaSeq pointer was being copied.
 *
 * Because I don't want to spend any more time figuring this out, and more importantly,
 * because I actually don't need to have two different storage paradigms for
 * ELBA, I'm just going to get rid of circumstance (1) listed above.
 *
 * Therefore, this DnaSeq object is currently to be used ONLY in a context
 * where its memory is given by an underlying DnaBuffer object. I may change
 * this later but right now I don't see any reason to.

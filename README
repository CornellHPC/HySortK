You need to use `samtools` to index the dataset before running the kmer counter.

To compile, load the MPI + OpenMP environment and use `make`. An example is

```sh
make K=31 M=17 L=2 U=50 LOG=2 -j8
```

To run the kmer counter, use your mpi runner with `./ukmerc $PATH_TO_DATASE`. For example, to run on perlmutter (in the interactive environment) with 4 nodes, use

```sh
srun -N 4 -n 32 -c 64 --cpu_bind=cores ./ukmerc ${PATH_TO_DATASET}
```
